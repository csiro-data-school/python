## Use variables to store values

You've seen how Python can be used as a calculator:
~~~
3 + 5 * 4
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
23
~~~
{: .output}

This is great but not very interesting.
To do anything useful with data, we need to assign its value to a _variable_.
In Python, we can [assign]({{ page.root }}/reference/#assign) a value to a
[variable]({{ page.root }}/reference/#variable), using the equals sign `=`.
For example, to assign the value `60` to a variable `weight_kg`, we would execute:

~~~
weight_kg = 60
~~~
{: .language-python}

From now on, whenever we use `weight_kg`, Python will substitute the value we assigned to
it. In essence, **a variable is just a name for a value**.

In Python, variable names:

 - can include letters, digits, and underscores
 - cannot start with a digit
 - are [case sensitive]({{ page.root }}/reference/#case-sensitive).
 - underscores at the start like `__alistairs_real_age` have a special meaning
    so we won't do that until we understand the convention.

This means that, for example:
 - `weight0` is a valid variable name, whereas `0weight` is not
 - `weight` and `Weight` are different variables

## Variables must be created before they are used.

*   If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled,
    Python reports an error.
    *   Unlike some languages, which "guess" a default value.

~~~
last_name
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c1fbb4e96102> in <module>()
----> 1 last_name

NameError: name 'last_name' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}

*   The last line of an error message is usually the most informative.
*   We will look at error messages in detail [later]({{ site.github.url }}/10-errors/).


## Python is case-sensitive.

*   Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different,
    so `Name` and `name` are different variables.
*   There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names
    so we will use lower-case letters for now.


~~~
weight_kg
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
60
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
Weight_kg
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-4ab70f7f1bf7> in <module>()
----> 1 Weight_kg

NameError: name 'Weight_kg' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}

## Use `print` to display values.

*   Python has a built-in function called `print` that prints things as text.
*   Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name.
*   Provide values to the function (i.e., the things to print) in parentheses.
*   The values passed to the function are called 'arguments'

~~~
first_name = Ahmed
age = 42
print(first_name, 'is', age, 'years old')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Ahmed is 42 years old
~~~
{: .output}

*   `print` automatically puts a single space between items to separate them.
*   And wraps around to a new line at the end.


## Variables persist between cells.

*   Variables defined in one cell exist in all other cells once executed,
    so the relative location of cells in the notebook do not matter (i.e., cells
    lower down can still affect those above).
*   Notebook cells are just a way to organize a program;
    as far as Python is concerned,
    all of the source code is one long set of instructions.

~~~
print(first_name, 'weighs', weight_kg, 'kg')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Ahmed weighs 60 kg
~~~
{: .output}


## Use meaningful variable names.

*   Python doesn't care what you call variables as long as they obey the rules
    (alphanumeric characters and the underscore).

~~~
flabadab = 42
ewr_422_yY = 'Ahmed'
print(ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'years old')
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   Use meaningful variable names to help other people understand what the program does.
*   The most important "other person" is your future self.

## Variables can be used in calculations.

*   We can use variables in calculations just as if they were values.
    *   Remember, we assigned 42 to `age` a few lines ago.

~~~
age = age + 3
print('Age in three years:', age)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Age in three years: 45
~~~
{: .output}

## Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.

*   If we make one cell in a spreadsheet depend on another,
    and update the latter,
    the former updates automatically.
*   This does **not** happen in programming languages.

~~~
first = 1
second = 5 * first
first = 2
print('first is', first, 'and second is', second)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
first is 2 and second is 5
~~~
{: .output}

*   The computer reads the value of `first` when doing the multiplication,
    creates a new value, and assigns it to `second`.
*   After that, `second` does not remember where it came from.
