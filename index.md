This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses file processing as the motivating example,
and is designed to be used in both [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
This lesson assumes that you will be working from the command-line with Python files and the command-line Python interpreter.
The exercises could be completed in other environments such as [Jupyter][jupyter] or an [IDE][python_ide], but this may require some small adaptations to the exercises.

> ## Why Python 3?
>
> Please note that this lesson uses [Python 3][python3] rather than [Python 2][python2]. Support for Python 2 is due to end in 2020, and users are strongly urged to move to Python 3 as soon as possible. Given this, it makes sense that new users should start with Python 3. As an added bonus, this allows us to make use of some new features of Python 3.

> ## Prerequisites
>
>1. Learners need to have a basic familiarity with the command line. Specifically, you need to
>   understand:
>       1. what files and directories are,
>       2. what a working directory is,
>       3. how to start a Python interpreter,
>       4. and how to execute Python files.
>
> 2. Learners must install Python before the class starts.
>
> 3. Learners must download the data before class starts:
>    please download and unzip the file
>    [introduction_to_python_data.zip]({{page.root}}/files/introduction_to_python_data.zip).
>
>    Please see [the setup instructions]({{ page.root }}/setup/)
>    for details.
